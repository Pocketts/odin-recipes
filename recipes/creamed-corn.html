    <h4>This is NOTHING like canned creamed corn! My husband is not a fan of corn or creamed dishes, but he thinks this is great. Easy and quick to prepare and is an especially delicious side dish for chicken or pork. Everyone always asks for the recipe.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen corn kernels, thawed</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li> 
        <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
