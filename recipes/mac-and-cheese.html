    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Processed Cheese</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pick the right cheese</strong>
            There are some rules. First, the cheese. It's got to be a processed style. We're talking:
            <ul>
                <li>Yellow or white brick American</li>
                <li>Velveeta</li>
                <li>Gooey melters like Provel</li>
                <li>Grocery store-sliced Gouda (not the nice wax-rind or aged stuff)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Get your cheese-to-cream ratio right</strong> Now it's just all about ratios, and this is easy to remember. Your ratio for this sauce is 1:2 cheese to cream in ounces. So, for one person, a good serving is 2 ounces of cheese to 4 of cream, but if you want to make for a crowd, say using 2 pounds of dried pasta? Go for 1 pound of cheese to 1 quart of cream. PRO TIP: Weigh your cheese first and then grate. And do not use pre-shredded or grated cheese as the anti-clumping agents make them prone to grittiness.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce!</strong>
            To make the sauce, heat the cream in a medium saucepan over medium high heat until simmering (you should just see tiny bubbles and movement around the edges of the pot).  Stir in your grated cheese and keep stirring until you get the texture of melted Velveeta (which will be really easy you are using Velveeta!). Keep stirring and reduce the sauce slightly, being careful not to burn or scorch it.
            
            Taste for seasoning: You may want the barest pinch of salt depending on the cheese you've used. It's your choice on pepper; I prefer mine without but go with what you love. Hold the sauce over very low heat or in a slow cooker set on warm until your pasta is done. Cook your pasta to al dente in well-salted water. Drain the pasta and combine with the cheese sauce.  Serve hot.
            
            You can make this cheese sauce ahead, and just reheat in a pan over low heat, adding a splash more cream if it has tightened up too much. Made ahead, it will last up to 5 days in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
